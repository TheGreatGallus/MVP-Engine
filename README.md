# MVP Engine
 
NOTE: This application is currently a direct migration from an old work-in-progress BitBucket repository. There may be some issues with the initial commit as this is the first time I've migrated a project across version control services.

As of this commit, it is missing the ability to create a new game directory, as well as the template directory used for manually creating a new game during previous development.

I plan to update this repository in the near future with the ability to create a new game so that it is actually usable beyond launching.

Also, only the MVP Editor project is intended to be run at this point in development, as the MVP Engine project will require a game directory to be loaded.
